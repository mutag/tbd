# PHP MySQL Tasklist application
# This set of code uses PHP includes to connect to the database with username and password
# PHP includes are also used for getting the HTML for head, banner, navbar and footer sections
# This version is a refactoring of code written in 2003 and is pretty likely to be unsafe and/or vulnerable
# In fact the underlying database on my host will be locked
